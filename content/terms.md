Basically though:

* Our voucher terms and conditions must be displayed before a user can reserve a voucher.
* The styling of the voucher page and voucher validation page on your app must be visually idential
to ours, allowing for some of your branding around it.
* If your partner API key becomes compromised, you must notify us immediately so we can blacklist it.
* If you store or cache any of our non-public data in your database and the data becomes compromised,
or you think it may have been compromised, you must notify us immediately.
